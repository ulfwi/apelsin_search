# TODO

* Add functionality to delete commands (only possible for favorites now)
  * .bash_history might require special handling since it has # as well
* Handle printing emojis: ðŸ“ˆ
  * There's something strange with it so it makes us write past the end of the terminal
* Move config files to ~/.config
